This project tracks the "friend" lists of a selection of Twitter accounts associated with the Trump administration.

## Criteria

The list of tracked accounts includes the US president and vice president, their immediate families,
all accounts affiliated with `@WhiteHouse`, `@Interior`, `@TheJusticeDept`, or `@DOGE`, miscellaneous
people close to the administration (like `@elonmusk`), people who were close to the previous Trump
administration, and a few media companies or individuals. In a few cases accounts that you might expect
to see here (such as `@Interior`) are not included, because their friend lists are too large to be interesting.

I'm tracking friend and follower lists for many accounts not included in the `accounts.csv` list in this repository,
but most are outside the scope of this project.

Feel free to open an issue or [message me](https://bsky.app/profile/travisbrown.dev) if you have suggestions about
additional accounts to track.
